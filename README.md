# VGGArt
Using Tensor flow with a VGG network to create Art from input photographs and input pieces of Art.
This is based on the paper by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.

The VGG implementation in TensorFlow is based on http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/   
Model from https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/211839e770f7b538e2d8#file-readme-md     
Weights from Caffe converted using https://github.com/ethereon/caffe-tensorflow 
I've also drawn heavily from the google deepdream tensorflow tutorial
